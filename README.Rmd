```
A package extending the capability of [botrnot](https://github.com/mkearney/botrnot) by measuring suspected bot activity in any 
given Twitter query. The model is 91.78% accurate when classifying bots and 
92.61% accurate when classifying non-bots, per [mkearney](https://github.com/mkearney). This README is derived from Dr. Kearney's excellent [rtweet]((https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet)) documentation.

## Install

Install from Github with the following code:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("mkearney/botrnot")
devtools::install_github("kurtawirth/botscan")
```

This package connects <code>botrnot</code> to <code>rtweet</code>. As a result, each user must have 
previously acquired authentication from Twitter and instructions to do that 
[can be found here](http://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html).

## Usage

There is only one function currently live for botscan. 

The first argument takes any Twitter query, complete with boolean operators if
desired.

The second argument takes a number, less than one, that represents the desired 
threshold at which an account should be considered a bot. This argument's 
default is .899, understood as any account that is more than 89.9 percent 
likely to be a bot should be considered a bot.

The third argument allows the user to toggle between user-level and
conversation-level data. This argument's default is set to conversation-level
data, understood as what percentage of the queried conversation is bot-related.
If <code>user_level</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, <code>botscan</code> 
will return user-level data, understood as what percentage of the queried 
conversation's authors are estimated to be bots.

```{r usage, eval = FALSE}
## load botscan
library(botscan)

## Enter query surrounded by quotation marks
botscan("#rstats")
#> [1] 0.1642276

## Result is percentage - in this case, 16.42276%.

## If desired, choose the threshold
botscan("#rstats", th = .995)
#> [1] 0.02398524

## Result is percentage - in this case, 02.398524%.

##If desired, scan only users rather than the conversation as a whole.
botscan("rstats", user_level = TRUE)
#> [1] 0.1505155

##Result is percentage - in this case, 02.398524%.
```

Twitter rate limits cap the number of search results returned to 18,000 every 
15 minutes. Thus, excessive use of <code>botscan</code> in a short amount of 
time may result in a warning and inability to pull results. In this event, 
simply wait 15 minutes and try again.

## Notes

*Retweets are not currently included in the conversation count.

*Tweets are gathered by searching Twitter for a given query.

*In an effort to avoid the Twitter rate limit cap, <code>botscan</code> limits 
searches to 1000 results.
